# Graveyard Shift

This game is built with vanilla javascript and the backend is built with Rails. Stop skeletons from rising out of their graves by planting flowers. Click on a grave to read the gravestone in order to find out how many flowers need to be planted. Users can dig new graves and write custom epitaphs. At night, skeletons will rise out of their graves and follow your mouse.
